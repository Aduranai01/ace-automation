# The network team (netops) owns the repository, so this first definition (if uncommneted) would enforce 
# requiring their review for any changes to any file in the repo

# * @<netops>

# Next, we would override that global definition and give responsibility for the allowed_domains.tf to
# the security team (secops). By uncommenting this next line, even the network team needs the approval
# of security to make changes to this file.

# /dcf/allowed_domains.tf @<secops> @<devops>

# Notice the development team (devops) is also required to review changes to allowed_domains.tf as its
# a good practice to have a secondary (code review) approval from the team making changes as well as
# (in this case) security review.
