# Summary  

**Congratulations!!!**  

You have just built, enhanced, and secured a multi-cloud network by using automation. By using git branches and enabling collaboration with DevOps and SecOps teams to build CI/CD pipelines with secured branches, you have experienced true NetOps in action. Many of Aviatrix's largest customers practice IaC day in and day out. While the choice of tools (e.g. Jenkins instead of Terraform Cloud, GitLab instead of GitHub) may vary across enterprises, the concepts of Infrastructure as Code remain the same.

Be sure to clean up your resources to avoid any excess charges.
